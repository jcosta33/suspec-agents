The evidence behind swarm-agents' design and its honest-scope claims. Verified in the deep-research
refresh of 2026-06-21 (swarm-hq `specs/swarm-agents/research-shipping.md`, 3-vote adversarial
verification); re-check primary sources before relying on a version-specific detail.

## Claude Code subagents (the authoring + enforcement surface)
- Claude Code — Subagents (frontmatter fields, scopes, isolation, `tools`/`disallowedTools`,
  `permissionMode`, `PreToolUse` blocking, `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`, built-in agents):
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents

## The bypass / honest-limit evidence
- claude-code#25000 — subagent Bash tool-scoping bypass (bare-name deny rules dropped before
  evaluation): https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25000
- claude-code#43142, #54898 — related open subagent permission/bypass reports:

## The runner landscape (founding-gate evidence)
- GitHub Copilot — custom agents configuration:

- Gemini CLI — subagents: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/core/subagents.md

## Delegation-provenance prior art (vocab alignment)

## Swarm canon (the contract)
- ADR-0088 (delegation-provenance contract), ADR-0077 (reconcile-only / a record never a verdict),
  ADR-0056 (adversarial self-review), ADR-0063 (honesty framework / levels), ADR-0092 (founding
  swarm-agents) — the `ADR-NNNN` citations in these docs live at
  [github.com/jcosta33/swarm/tree/main/docs/adrs](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm/tree/main/docs/adrs).

## Paired guides (optional see-alsos named in the agent bodies)
- The authoring guides (`write-spec`, `write-audit`, `write-research`, `write-inventory`,
  `review-output`) ship in the [starter kit](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit); the
  `write-documentation` guide and the `empirical-proof` discipline ship in
  [swarm-skills](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-skills). None is a dependency — each agent body
  stands alone.
