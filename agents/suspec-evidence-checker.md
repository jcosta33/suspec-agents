# suspec-evidence-checker (retired → suspec-reviewer proof-first mode)

This agent has been **retired**. Its whole job — re-run every `## Verify` item yourself and paste the
verbatim output, then flag any claim that lacks matching evidence — is exactly **step 2 of
[`suspec-reviewer`](./suspec-reviewer.md)**, a strict subset of the review packet. Keeping a separate
agent for it was a sequencing convenience, not a second role.

## Use suspec-reviewer's proof-first mode instead

When you want the checks proven _now_ — without the diff-read and coverage-table work of a full review —
delegate to **[`suspec-reviewer`](./suspec-reviewer.md)** and ask for its **proof-first mode**: re-run
the task's Verify items, paste the verbatim output (command · last lines · exit status), confirm each
run actually collected the named tests, and flag every claim with no matching re-run as **Unverified** —
stopping before the diff-read, coverage table, and maintainability lenses. Same no-verdict contract:
it produces evidence; the human (or the full review) judges.

This stub carries `name: suspec-evidence-checker` only so a stale inbound reference resolves to this
redirect. Do not copy it into a repo as a working agent.
